    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    self_archiver: A class to save a timestamped snapshot of a Jupyter notebook or Python script. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Purpose:\n",
    "    --------\n",
    "    \n",
    "    When making generative art, it is useful to be able to strongly link output files with\n",
    "    their generating script and the parameters that were used to make them.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    One approach is to save a parameters file alongside the script's output, but this requires\n",
    "    the script to handle reading and saving of parameter files.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Instead, self_archiver makes it easy to copy the entire notebook or script into a timestamped folder,\n",
    "    so it is preserved with all the parameters used for that output run. This timestamped folder\n",
    "    is also used by the script as the destination for any output files for this run.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The result is therefore a timestamped folder containing the script's output files, plus a copy\n",
    "    of the script as it was at the moment it generated them.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Usage:\n",
    "    ------\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Place self_archiver.ipynb into the same directory as your notebook.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Add %run self_archiver.ipynb at the top of your notebook. You can now use the class.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Only one instance per file is needed and it takes no arguments.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - When an instance is created, the current date and time are saved to selfarchiver.datetime.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - self.savepath should be used as the path the notebook uses to generate any outupt files.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - When the notebook has reached the end of its execution and output, self_archiver.archive() should be called.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - This is so that the output cells, and any notebook edits between class instantiation and \n",
    "      self_archiver.archive() execution, can be captured.\n",
    "      \n",
    "    - When self_archiver.archive() is called, the notebook is saved, and a copy of this notebook is saved to:\n",
    "            \n",
    "                <THIS NOTEBOOK'S DIR>\\Output\\%Y-%m-%d--%H-%M-%S\\<THIS NOTEBOOK'S FILENAME>\n",
